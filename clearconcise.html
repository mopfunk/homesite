  <h1>Concise, Clear and Under Control</h1>

    <p>The difference between great writing and not-so-great writing depends on how well one understands the words "clear" and "concise" and how they apply those concepts to the craft of writing.</p>

    <p>If you are new to writing it is normal to not always write with a strong focus. You may have a tendency to bounce between ideas, create dragging sentences or bury the purpose of your piece under too many adjectives and poor descriptors. For those wanting to break into professional writing it is of the utmost importance to learn to write in a clear and concise manner. Studying what makes writing clear and concise will bump your writing skills up a notch or two and separate you from other writers.</p>

  <h2>Conversation Is Key</h2>

    <p>To keep things simple write as if you are having a conversation with your audience.</p>

    <p>Write in a fashion that does not alienate your target audience. The level of difficulty in understanding your piece depends on your field, but a good rule of thumb is to keep it as succinct as possible.</p>

    <p>For example, if you are writing an academic paper on artificial intelligence and how it sheds light on human consciousness, then you can make the assumption that those reading it will have a basic understanding of the material prior to reading your work. Even in that case you want to converse with your fellow academics; do not try to impress them with wordy language and a superior voice.</p>

    <p>If you are writing a "How To" guide on painting a child's bedroom then you do not need to go into the physics of how paint dries or paintbrushes work. Write like you would be talking to a friend or a fellow parent.</p>

    <p>Remember who you are writing to, and keep it as simple as you can.</p>

  <h2>Critical Reading Is Critical</h2>

    <p>If you want to develop a writing style that is brief and effective it is wise to learn to read critically.</p>

    <p>Critical reading tends to have a negative connotation, but it does not mean that you must tear apart what you read and try to find as many errors as there are grains of sand in the world. To read with a critical mind means to ask questions, to contemplate the ideas presented and to study the style of the author.</p>

    <p>Asking questions whenever you read promotes a healthy exploration of the information you are gathering. It helps your mind to grow because you are challenging what you see before you, but more importantly you are challenging what you know. This challenge is key to developing more perspective, understanding and knowledge because it will cause you to either shift in your views or reaffirm your thoughts.</p>

    <p>Contemplating what you gather from any passage, paper or poem is a much needed exercise for your mind. Whenever you contemplate what you have absorbed it encourages exploration into new intellectual territories. Giving yourself time to meditate upon your readings leads to deeper understanding. See where your thoughts go but do not chase them or ask questions during this exercise. Watch your thoughts and how they interact with the ideas you were presented with -- and do nothing more. You will be surprised how much you can learn from being an observer of your thoughts rather than a dictator.</p>

    <p>By studying an author's style you can see what works and what does not. As you begin to read critically you will see that some writers do not engage your mind because their style is not developed or they try too hard to write a certain way that is not in line with their natural writing voice. Other writers will show you a clear window into their thoughts. As George Orwell stated "Good prose is like a windowpane." If you are to remember any quote on writing it is that one. The writers that have a style that is clear, concise and thoughtful are the ones who will teach you the most about style thus granting you with more power to find your voice as a writer.</p>
