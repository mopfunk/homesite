  <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
    <p>When it comes to writing - whether creative or professional - I live by a few simple rules.</p>
    <p>My first rule of thumb is to be <a href="clearconcise.html">clear and concise</a>. The second is to write, write, write, and read, read, read. The last rule is to enjoy what you are doing. If you can do those things than you are already ahead of the average writer.</p>

    <p>Through talks with other writers I have found that the second tip - to read and write often - is the hardest to live by. Sure, you can be a concise writer. You can love writing, too. What seems to be the most difficult, however, is keeping the craft of writing a habit rather than something to pursue only under great inspiration. Writing, like anything else, takes time, patience, and commitment. The time given to practice does not need to be much, either. Just twenty minutes a day at your keyboard (or notebook) can be enough to get those wheels spinning.</p>

    <p>Here are <a href="threehabits.html">three simple habits</a>that may be of use.</p>
